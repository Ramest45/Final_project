2. Backend Development:

3. Database Management:

- SQLite: Used as the database for managing the data like student information, login credentials, and course materials.
  
4. Additional Features:

- Email Integration: System-generated emails sent upon student registration.
- SMS API Integration: Automated SMS notifications sent to users during the inquiry process.
  
5. Project Modules:
